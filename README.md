SODABTC:

This smart contract mints and distributes SODABTC between borrowers who have provided Bitcoin (BTC) as a collateral to take out a loan on SODA. Also it burns SODABTC after the borrower pays back the loan and receives their collateral in Bitcoins (BTC) back.

Borrowing:

In order to borrow cryptoassets on SODA the user needs to provide Bitcoins (BTC) as a collateral. The collateral is a guarantee of the borrowerâ€™s ability to repay a loan. One cannot borrow funds on SODA without having provided collateral. In addition, the user needs to have a MetaMask Dapp browser to receive and use borrowed cryptoassets (not your keys, not your crypto). Early SODA versions will allow users to borrow Ethereum-based cryptoassets (ERC-20).
